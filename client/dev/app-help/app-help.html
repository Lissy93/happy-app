  <h2>What is Happy-App?</h2>
  <p>
    A simple web app to help gauge moral for members of the team. Data is collected anonymously,
    and results are displayed visually on the dashboard.
  </p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    Automated emails are sent out to every team member at the same time each day, containing
    three links (good, average, bad). The user clicks a link, depending on how they feel the day went.
    Responses are then made anonymous and saved instantly.
    <br><br>
    Both team leads, and team members can see the dashboard, which shows a summary of results, for each team,
    and overall - for all teams. There are different charts to show different analytics,
    including sentiment over time, sentiment per team, and current sentiment breakdown.
    <br><br>
    The admin will be able to log in and configure tha apps settings, such as time and frequency of emails,
    and team member mailing lists.
  </p>

  <h2>How can I configure it for my team?</h2>
  <p>
    A server is required, and a copy of the files. A developer or system admin will then install it, which
    is a straightforward process. The team lead or SCRUM master will then configure the app and teams through
    the admin dashboard. This can later be modified at any time.
